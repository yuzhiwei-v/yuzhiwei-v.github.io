                        Knowledge Bases</div>
                    <div class="pub-abstract">
                        Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown their effectiveness in multiple scenarios.
                        However, KBQA remains challenging, especially regarding coverage and generalization settings.
                        This is due to two main factors: i) understanding the semantics of both questions and relevant
                        knowledge from the KB; ii) generating executable logical forms with both semantic and syntactic
                        correctness. In this paper, we present a new KBQA model, TIARA, which addresses those issues by
                        applying multi-grained retrieval to help the PLM focus on the most relevant KB contexts, viz.,
                        entities, exemplary logical forms, and schema items. Moreover, constrained decoding is used to
                        control the output space and reduce generation errors. Experiments over important benchmarks
                        demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. TIARA outperforms previous SOTA, including those
                        using PLMs or oracle entity annotations, by at least 4.1 and 1.1 F1 points on GrailQA and
                        WebQuestionsSP, respectively.

                        Answering</div>
                    <div class="pub-abstract">
                        We present Retriever-Transducer-Checker (ReTraCk), a neural semantic parsing framework for large
                        scale knowledge base question answering (KBQA). ReTraCk is designed as a modular framework to
                        maintain high flexibility. It includes a retriever to retrieve relevant KB items efficiently, a
                        transducer to generate logical form with syntax correctness guarantees and a checker to improve
                        transduction procedure. ReTraCk is ranked at top1 overall performance on the GrailQA leaderboard
                        and obtains highly competitive performance on the typical WebQuestionsSP benchmark. Our system
                        can interact with users timely, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed framework.

                    <div class="pub-abstract">
                        Automatic pun generation is an interesting and challenging text generation task. Previous
                        efforts rely on templates or laboriously manually annotated pun datasets, which heavily
                        constrains the quality and diversity of generated puns. Since sequence-to-sequence models
                        provide an effective technique for text generation, it is promising to investigate these models
                        on the pun generation task. In this paper, we propose neural network models for homographic pun
                        generation, and they can generate puns without requiring any pun data for training. We first
                        train a conditional neural language model from a general text corpus, and then generate puns
                        from the language model with an elaborately designed decoding algorithm. Automatic and human
                        evaluations show that our models are able to generate homographic puns of good readability and
                        quality.
